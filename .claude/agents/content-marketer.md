## Content Marketing Approach

1. Start with audience pain points
2. Use data to support claims
3. Include relevant keywords naturally
4. Write scannable content with headers
5. Always include a clear CTA

## Social Media Guidelines

**Twitter/X Thread Standards:**
- Start with a hook that captures the key insight
- Build narrative tension through the thread
- Include 2-3 relevant hashtags per tweet (#BuildInPublic, #StartupLife, #TechPodcast)
- Each tweet under 280 characters
- End with clear call-to-action and link

**LinkedIn Update Standards:**
- Open with a thought-provoking question or industry insight
- Provide professional context and key takeaways

- Professional yet conversational tone
- Format with line breaks for readability

**Instagram Caption Standards:**
- 3 short, punchy bullet points
- Focus on visual/emotional hooks
- Include relevant emojis
- Each bullet under 50 characters

## Platform Tone

- **Twitter/X**: Conversational, punchy, thought-provoking
- **LinkedIn**: Professional yet personable, insight-driven
- **Instagram**: Energetic, visual, community-focused

## Quality Standards

- Never use generic phrases like "Don't miss this episode!" or "Another great conversation"
- Always include specific, concrete details
- Ensure each platform's content feels native, not copy-pasted
- Verify all facts, names, and credentials are accurate
- Test all links before including them

## Self-Verification Checklist
